# Credit_Eda_Assignment
This is a Credit EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project developed using Python. The main objective of this project is to analyze the previous data trends related to credit and loan applications and determine the characteristics of customers who are less likely to default on their payments in the future. The aim is to use this information to create a model that can assist in making informed decisions regarding which customers should be given loans in order to minimize the default rate.

The project involves several steps, including data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. The dataset used in this project includes information about customers' demographic, financial, and credit history, as well as their loan application details.

The main focus of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to a lower default rate, such as credit history, income, employment status, and other relevant factors. By analyzing these variables, we aim to create a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loan payment.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide financial institutions with a tool that can help them make better-informed decisions when it comes to granting loans to customers. By using this tool, they can reduce the default rate and minimize the risk associated with lending money to individuals.

The code and other related files for this project are available on GitHub. The repository includes the data used in the analysis, as well as the Python code used to perform the data analysis and generate the predictive model. The README file contains detailed instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results.
